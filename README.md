# UnoDOS 3.12 Wolf

The alternative operating system for divMMC. Finely tuned.

## Build prerequisites

The preferred IDE is _Visual Studio Code_ (https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Imanolea's _Z80 Assembly_ extension (install from the app).

The compiler is the _RASM_ assembler.

## Components

The OS comprises:

* __KERNEL__: The interface between the divMMC hardware and the host machine.
* __COMMANDS__: Small programs that provide shell functions when using UnoDOS 3 without SE Basic IV. 
* __KEXTS__: Third-party kernel extensions that provide additional functionality.
